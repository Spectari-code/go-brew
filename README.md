## Architecture

Go Brew follows the **Model-View-Update (MVU)** architecture pattern from the Bubbletea framework:

- **Model** (`model.go`): Application state and data
- **View** (`view.go`): UI rendering and display logic
- **Update** (`update.go`): Event handling and state transitions
- **Config** (`config.go`): Configuration management and presets
- **Audio** (`audio.go`): Cross-platform audio playback

### Key Dependencies

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Ensure all tests pass (`go test`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Working

Go Brew includes multiple fallback mechanisms for audio:

1. **Primary**: MP3 playback using `alert.mp3`
2. **Fallback 1**: System sound files
3. **Fallback 2**: Terminal bell character

If audio isn't working, ensure:
- `alert.mp3` exists in the same directory as the binary
- Your system has audio capabilities
- Try running in a terminal that supports audio

### Terminal Compatibility

Go Brew works in most modern terminals:
- Terminal.app (macOS)
- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Windows Terminal
- GNOME Terminal (Linux)
- Konsole (Linux)

For best results, use a terminal that supports:
- ANSI colors
- Unicode characters (for progress bar)
- Alternative screen mode

## Performance

- **Memory Usage**: ~2-5MB RAM during operation
- **CPU Usage**: <1% during normal operation
- **Binary Size**: ~3-5MB (depending on platform)
